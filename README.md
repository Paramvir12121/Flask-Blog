## Introduction

This repository contains a Flask-based web application designed for blogging and user interactions. It supports user authentication using AWS Cognito, forms handling with Flask-WTF, and database interactions via SQLAlchemy.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization with AWS Cognito
- Form validations with Flask-WTF
- Data persistence using SQLAlchemy with a SQLite backend
- Bootstrap 5 for responsive front-end design

## Routes

- /: The home page displaying posts.
- /about: Static about page.
- /contact: Contact form for sending messages.
- /awslogin: AWS Cognito integrated login page.
- /new_password: Handle new password requirements for Cognito.
- /awslogout: Logout route that clears session data.
- /secure_area: Example secure area that requires authentication.

## Project Structure

- /flask:
    - server.py: Main Flask application setup and routes.
    - /templates: HTML templates for the application.
    - /static: Static files like images and CSS.
    - /instance: Contains the local db for testing. In production use cloud db.
- requirements.txt: List of packages required to run the application.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Paramvir12121/Flask-Blog.git
    ```
2. Change directory to the cloned repository:
    ```
    cd your-repository-name
    ```
3. Install required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Usage
To run the application locally:
Set environment variables for AWS Cognito in your .env file:
    ```
    COGNITO_REGION=your_cognito_region
    USER_POOL_ID=your_user_pool_id
    APP_CLIENT_ID=your_app_client_id
    ```
4. Run the Flask server:
```
python flask/server.py
```
## Dependencies
All dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. Major Dependencies are:
- Flask: Flask is used as the core framework for your web application. It is responsible for creating the app instance, defining routes, and handling requests. For instance, app  Flask(__name__) initializes the Flask application, and the decorators @app.route are used to map URLs to Python functions.

- Flask-WTF: This extension is utilized for handling forms. You use FlaskForm to define forms such as LoginForm, SignupForm, and PostForm. These forms handle user input for authentication, signing up, and posting messages. It integrates seamlessly with your templates to validate user input against specified criteria.

- WTForms: While part of Flask-WTF, WTForms alone is responsible for defining form fields and validation rules. Itâ€™s used extensively in defining forms like LoginForm, where fields and validation rules are specified (e.g., StringField, PasswordField with validators such as DataRequired()).

- Flask-SQLAlchemy: This is used to interact with the SQLite database. It manages the creation of database models and handles all database transactions. For example, db = SQLAlchemy(model_class=Base) initializes the SQLAlchemy object, and models like User and UserPost inherit from db.Model, making them part of the ORM.

- Flask-Bootstrap: Flask-Bootstrap is used to integrate Bootstrap into Flask easily. It is initialized with bootstrap = Bootstrap5(app), which enables Bootstrap templates and forms to render with Bootstrap styling by default, enhancing the UI design and responsiveness without additional CSS.

- Boto3: Boto3 is the AWS SDK used primarily for AWS Cognito authentication. Functions like sign_in utilize Boto3 to interact with AWS Cognito services, handling user authentication processes such as signing in and responding to authentication challenges.

- python-dotenv: Used to load environment variables from a .env file at the start of your application with load_dotenv(). This approach is used to manage sensitive information such as AWS access keys and your Flask application's secret key without hardcoding them into the source code.

- Flask-Cognito: This extension enables your application to use AWS Cognito for user authentication. It helps manage session tokens and user authentication states with decorators like @cognito_auth_required, which you use to protect routes that require a user to be logged in.



- SQLAlchemy: SQLAlchemy, which is integrated into Flask through Flask-SQLAlchemy, is used for defining the ORM models and handling the SQL transactions transparently. It is pivotal in operations that involve creating, querying, updating, or deleting records from your SQLite database.

## Configuration
The application uses environment variables stored in a .env file for configuration. These include keys for AWS Cognito and the Flask app's secret key.
